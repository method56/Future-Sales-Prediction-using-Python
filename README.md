# Future-Sales-Prediction-using-Python
The dataset given uploaded here contains the data about the sales of the product. 
The dataset is about the advertising cost incurred by the business on various advertising platforms. 

Below is the description of all the columns in the dataset:

TV: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on TV;
Radio: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Radio;
Newspaper: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Newspaper;
Sales: Number of units sold;
So, the sales of the product depend on the advertisement cost of the product.

I used machine learning using Python to predict future sales.
